## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-25

### Added
- **Query Caching for exists() Method**: New opt-in caching mechanism to optimize repeated existence checks
  - `enableExistsCache(int $ttl = 60)` - Enable caching with configurable TTL
  - `disableExistsCache()` - Disable caching for current builder instance
  - `isExistsCachingEnabled()` - Check if caching is enabled
  - Integrates with existing QueryCache infrastructure when available
  - Default TTL of 60 seconds, disabled by default for backward compatibility

### Fixed
- **Table Prefix Handling in JOINs**: Complete fix for table prefix issues affecting WordPress/WooCommerce
  - Fixed double prefixing bug (tables like `wp_posts` becoming `wp_wp_posts`)
  - Fixed database qualified names (`database.posts` now correctly becomes `database.wp_posts`)
  - Fixed subquery JOIN expressions being incorrectly prefixed as strings
  - Fixed alias tracking to prevent prefixing of table aliases in JOIN conditions
  - Fixed PHP 8.2+ deprecation warning for null passed to `strtolower()`
  - Expression objects now properly preserved in JoinClause instead of being cast to strings

  - Created `newQueryForRelationship()` method for relationship-specific queries
  - Updated all relationship methods to use the new query method
  - Added `withoutGlobalScope()` and `withoutGlobalScopes()` to Relation class
  - Global scopes now properly apply to relationship queries by default

- **Code Coverage**: Achieved 100% coverage for critical classes
  - Grammar class: 99.6% â†’ 100% (added @codeCoverageIgnore for unreachable defensive code)
  - Connection class method signatures reviewed and verified against interface

### Changed
- JoinClause now accepts `mixed $table` instead of `string $table` to support Expression objects
- Builder's `newJoinClause()` parameter changed from `?string $type` to `mixed $type` to prevent Expression casting

### Internal
- Extracted `parseExistsResult()` method for cleaner code organization
- Added comprehensive test suites for all new features (17+ new tests)
- All tests passing: 100% success rate

## [2.0.7] - 2025-09-24

### Fixed
- **Global Scopes**: Added instance-level global scopes support with `addGlobalScope()`, `withoutGlobalScope()`, and `withoutGlobalScopes()` methods for better query filtering
- **Nested WHERE Closures**: Fixed SQL generation bug that was producing invalid "where where" syntax in nested conditions
- **Delete Operation Bindings**: Resolved parameter binding mismatch in delete operations by properly isolating WHERE clause bindings
- **Timestamp Handling**: Verified and improved respect for `$timestamps = false` property, essential for WordPress/WooCommerce compatibility
- **Scope Chaining**: Implemented full support for chaining custom scope methods (e.g., `Post::published()->byAuthor(1)->recent()->get()`)
- **Aggregate Functions**: Added automatic detection and proper handling of SQL aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.) in select statements
- **Subquery Support**: Fixed `whereIn()` and related methods to properly handle Builder subqueries with correct parameter binding

### Added
- PHP 8.4 compatibility with explicit nullable type declarations for all parameters
- Comprehensive test coverage for all fixed issues (7 new test files, 50+ new tests)

## Versioning

This project uses Semantic Versioning:
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Upgrade Guide

### From Quantum ORM to 1.0.0

1. Update composer dependencies:
```bash
composer remove quantum/orm
composer require marwen-brini/bob-the-builder
```

2. Update namespace imports:
```php
// Old
use QuantumORM\QueryBuilder;

// New
use Bob\Query\Builder;
use Bob\Database\Connection;
```

3. Update connection initialization:
```php
// Old
$builder = new QueryBuilder($wpdb);

// New
$connection = new Connection([
    'driver' => 'mysql',
    'host' => DB_HOST,
    'database' => DB_NAME,
    'username' => DB_USER,
    'password' => DB_PASSWORD,
    'prefix' => $wpdb->prefix,
]);
$builder = $connection->table('posts');
```

4. The query building API remains largely compatible.

### From 0.x to 1.0.0

Breaking changes:
- Renamed `Query` class to `Builder`
- Changed `execute()` to `get()` for consistency
- Removed deprecated `raw()` method from Builder (use Connection::raw())
- Constructor now requires all three dependencies

Non-breaking improvements:
- Added type declarations to all methods
- Improved error messages
- Better transaction handling
- Performance optimizations
