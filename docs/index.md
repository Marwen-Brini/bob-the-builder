## Quick Start

```php
use Bob\Database\Connection;

// Configure your connection
$connection = new Connection([
    'driver' => 'mysql',
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'database' => 'myapp',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => 'password',
]);

// Start building queries
$users = $connection->table('users')
    ->where('status', 'active')
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();
```

## Model Example

```php
use Bob\Database\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected string $table = 'posts';
    
    public static function findBySlug(string $slug): ?self
    {
        $result = static::query()
            ->where('slug', $slug)
            ->first();
        
        return $result ? static::hydrate($result) : null;
    }
}

// Use your custom methods
$post = Post::findBySlug('hello-world');
```

## Why Bob?

Bob Query Builder was born from the need for a powerful, standalone query builder that could enhance Quantum ORM's capabilities. But it quickly evolved into something more - a fully independent, framework-agnostic solution that brings Laravel's elegant query building to any PHP project.

### Perfect For:

- **WordPress Plugins** - Replace slow wpdb queries with optimized prepared statements
- **Microservices** - Lightweight database layer without framework overhead  
- **Legacy Modernization** - Gradually modernize database code without full rewrites
- **Performance Critical Apps** - Connection pooling, caching, and profiling built-in
- **Learning Projects** - Clean, well-documented code that's easy to understand

## Installation

Install Bob via Composer:

```bash
composer require marwen-brini/bob-the-builder
```

That's it! No complex configuration or bootstrapping required.
